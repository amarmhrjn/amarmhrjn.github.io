<p>
    My research interests include point set registration, human pose estimation, deep learning, semi-supervised learning, computer vision, machine learning. 
    <br /><br /> 
    I am a PhD candidate student at the University of North Texas (UNT), Denton. My research is on **non-rigid registration of point set with large and uneven deformation** such as (3D) point sets representing complex articutaed human poses. To achieve accurate non-rigid registration in such challenging cases, my work use both local neighborhood constraint and global shape constraint in the registration. I am expected to graduate on Fall 2021 or Spring 2022.
    <br /><br />
    Prior to joining the PhD program at the UNT, I worked in the industry for about 9 years. During that period, I was involved in many projects which includes embedded programming, font (web font) technologies, web development. I have both academic and real world working experiences in many programming languages (and frameworks) such as C/C++, C#, .NET, python, pytorch, Matlab, Objective-C, Java, Javascript etc.
