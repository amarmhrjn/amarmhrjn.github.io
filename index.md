# Welcome
<p>
    My research interests include point set registration, human pose estimation, deep learning, semi-supervised learning, computer vision, machine learning. I am a member of <b><a href="http://covis.cse.unt.edu/">Computer Vision and Intelligent Systems (CoVIS) Lab</a></b>.
    <br /><br /> 
    I am a PhD candidate student at the University of North Texas (UNT), Denton. My research is on <b>non-rigid registration of point set with large and uneven deformation</b> such as (3D) point sets representing complex articulated human poses. To achieve accurate non-rigid registration in such challenging cases, my work uses both local neighborhood constraint and global shape constraint in the registration.
    <br /><br />
    Prior to joining the PhD program at the UNT, I worked in the industry for about 9 years. During that period, I was involved in many projects which includes embedded programming, font (web font) technologies, web development. I have both academic and real-world working experiences in many programming languages (and frameworks) such as C/C++, C#, .NET, Python, PyTorch, Matlab, Objective-C, Java, Javascript etc.
